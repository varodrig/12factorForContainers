## I. Security First
### Ensuring your application is secure

Guidelines to consider your application running on a container platform:

* Security first means knowing your application security requirements and compliance. Before deploying your application in any environment, ensure you see the security restrictions, compliance, limitations, and obligations.
Ensure these considerations are taken care of:

1 - Revisit your application platform requirements. 

1.1 Can this application be deployed in containers? Should it be in a restricted environment? Cloud? On-Prem? 

1.2 Does my application required to follow any compliant program that requires running on a compliant environment?

2.1 - Revisit your existing platform's current specifications.

2.1 - Do I have access to the required environment to deploy my application there safely? For example, my application needs to run in a DMZ. Can I access a stable container platform environment running on a DMZ?

2.2 - If the application is required to be compliant. Is this environment compliant and available?

3 - Can I deploy my application safely? Do I have all the security constraints to build and deploy my application in this environment? Your application in any environment ensures you know about the security restrictions, compliance, and any limitations and obligations.
