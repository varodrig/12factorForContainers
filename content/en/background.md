Overview
==========

This document is born after helping several customers adopt OpenShift and containers. Developers need to know what minimal changes and best practices they need to follow to ensure the application will run in a container platform. This document will serve as a guide for new applications, new architectures, or any modernization efforts.

This guide is technology agnostic and it will serve for any enterprise/web application.

This tool was inspired by the Twelve-Factor App created by Heroku's team when they built this for applications to be ready to run on the cloud.
