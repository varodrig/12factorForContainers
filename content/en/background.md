Overview
==========

This document is born after helping several customers adopt OpenShift and containers. Developers need to know what are the minimal changes and best practices they needed to follow to ensure the application will run as a container. This document will serve as a guide for new applications, new architectures or any modernization efforts.  

The guide is technology agnostic and it will serve for any enterprise/web application.

This tool was inspired by the Twelve-Factor App created by Heroku's team when they built this for applications to be ready to run on the cloud.
